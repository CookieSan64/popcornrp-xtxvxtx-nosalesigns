Either you learn what GNU GPL licencing is and the definitive definition of open source, or you remove it completely; either everyone can access it, or nobody can.

Now apparently, the above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software. And exactly what is going to happen if it doesn't? Your fake Quebec lawyer will contact me? I'd love to see them try.

Adding clauses to a free open source license and claiming that everyone is free to use it except a particular list of people simply because they hurt your feelings, doesn't apply to GitHub or licensing in general. You and your  little boyfriend modified existing props of which are owned by Rockstar Games, therefore the only copyright holder in this situation is Rockstar Games themselves, and therefore you yourself are in breach of intellectual property rights.

It truly amazes me the way you never let an idea interrupt the flow of your typing yet making logical and factual points isn't entirely your area of expertise. Perhaps you should use your brain was a paperweight? It isn't much use for writing licenses.

Use this as you please, it's not like Nigerian Prince Albert Einstein over here can do jack shit about it.
